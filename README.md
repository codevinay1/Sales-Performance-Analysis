ðŸš€ Project Objective
The primary goal of this dashboard is to empower decision-makers by transforming raw sales data into an interactive analytical tool. It allows for the identification of top-performing products, profitable categories, and key customer segments, while also highlighting areas for operational improvement and strategic growth.

ðŸ“ˆ Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The main dashboard highlights four critical, high-level metrics for the entire period:


Total Sales: $2.3M 


Total Profit: $286.3K 


Total Quantity Sold: 37.9K 


Total Discount: $1.6K 

ðŸ’¡ Key Insights & Analysis
This dashboard uncovers several critical insights essential for business strategy:

1. Profitability vs. Sales

Critical Insight: The Furniture category, while a significant source of sales ($0.74M) , is a major drain on profitability, contributing only **$18.4K (6.44%)** to total profits.



High Performer: In contrast, the Technology category is the most valuable segment, generating the highest sales ($0.84M) and the most profit ($145.4K or 50.79% of total profit).


Recommendation: This suggests a need to re-evaluate the pricing, costs, or discount strategy for the Furniture category.

2. Customer Segmentation
The Consumer segment is the largest driver of business, accounting for over half of all sales ($1.16M, 50.56%).



The Corporate segment follows at $0.71M (30.74%) , with Home Office making up the remainder ($0.43M, 18.7%).





3. Shipping & Logistics
The vast majority of orders (59.12%) are fulfilled via Standard Class shipping.

This indicates that while expedited options like First Class (15.3%) and Second Class (19.99%)  are used, the bulk of the customer base prioritizes cost over speed.


4. Seasonal Trends
Sales data shows clear seasonality. There is a strong upward trend in the fourth quarter (Q4).

Monthly sales peaks occur in November and December , with another significant peak in March, indicating key periods for marketing and inventory management.


5. Top Products
The dashboard identifies high-value products driving the most revenue, such as the Fellowes PB500 Electric Punch ($27.5K in sales) and the HON 5400 Series Task Chairs ($21.9K in sales).
